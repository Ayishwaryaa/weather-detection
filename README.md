**weather-detection using Machine learning**

The dataset contains weather images classified into :

1. SUNNY
2. CLOUDY
3. RAINY
4. FOGGY
5. THUNDERSTORM

So , The images in the dataset are classified into 5 categories, and each category contains images of different sizes and different file formats such as jpg, jpeg, png etc.,.

The dataset contains a total of 1053 images (including the augmented images)

The dataset is classified into Training dataset and Testing dataset

Training dataset contains a total of 734 images

Testing dataset contains a total of 319 images

After training and testing the model,the accuracy of the model was 0.8746 ie. 87%

The model is able to detect some images correctly but some fine tuning and adjusting the parameters are to be done inorder to get higher accuracy and better detection
